# Storage classes

Each variable has a storage class which defines the features of that variable. It tells the compiler about where to store the variable, its initial value, scope (visibility level) and lifetime (global or local).

There are four storage classes in C++.

- auto
- extern
- static
- register
- mutable

Let's understand each of these one by one.
