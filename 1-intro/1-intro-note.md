## Variabels and literals
#### Initialization
We can also assign the value to a variable at the time of its declaration. Such assignment is known as **initialization**. Thus, we can  assign a value `4` to a variable `n` at the time of itsdeclaration as follows:
>int n = 4;

Here, we initialized a variable `n` with a value 4.

> An uninitialized variable takes some garbage value.

An **uninitialized** variable is the one to which we have not assigned any value.
Unlike some programming languages where a variable which has not been assigned any value takes a value zero, an uninitialized variable in C++ by default takes some ***garbage*** value.

## Data Types
Variabls can be of different types depending on the type of data it can store.
In the last example, the variable `n` was declared `int` ans thus can store an integer value. Therefore, it was of type `int`. Similarly, a variable which stores a character value is of type **char** i.e., it can store character values is of type `char` and so on.

We specify the type of a variable at the time of declaration. For exampl, a ...


## I-values and r-values
We know that when we declare a variable, it is given a memory location and its value is stored in that location. Each `memory location` has an address which becomes the address of the variabe which occupies that memory location.
