# Array
Array means collection. In C++ also, an array is a collection of similar types of data.
e.g. An array of `int` will contain only integers, an array of `double` will contain only doubles.
## Why array?
Suppose we need to store the marks of 50 students in a class and calculat ethe average marks. Declaring 50 separate variables will do the job but no programmer would like to do so> And here comes the **array** in action.

## How to declare an array
```C++
<datatype> <array_name> [ <array_size> ];
```

For example, take an integer array `n`:
`int n[6];`





## Initializing an array

## Pointer to Arrays
If we say that a variable `y` **points to an array** `n`, then it means that the value of `y` is the **address of the first element of the array** i.e., `n[0]`. So, `y` is the pointer to the array `n`.

## Passing the whole Array in Function

## For-each loop
