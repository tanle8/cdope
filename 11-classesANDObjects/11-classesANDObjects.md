# Classes and Objects

## Access Modifiers

The access modifiers decide _how_ the `members of a class` can be accessed.
There are three types fo access modifiers in C++.

- public

- private

- protected

### Public

When we declare any class member as __public__, that variable becomes available everywhere in the program, even outside the function in which it was declared.

### Private

### Protected

## Constructor

### Constructor having Parameters

## Use of Static

## Returning and Passing Object in a function
